# Step-by-Step Guide: Building an Authoritative Source from CSV in SailPoint IIQ

# 📘 Purpose of This Document

This document provides a **complete, beginner-friendly, step-by-step guide** for creating an 
**Authoritative Source Application** in SailPoint IdentityIQ using a **CSV (Delimited File)**.  

It explains:

- What each IAM and SailPoint term actually means  
- Why each configuration step is required  
- How to build the HR Employees authoritative application correctly  
- How schema discovery works  
- How IdentityIQ converts CSV rows into managed identities  
- How to preview, test, and validate the setup  
- A final cheat sheet summarizing all required values

By the end of this guide, you will fully understand **how IdentityIQ ingests employee data from a CSV file**, 
how it becomes an **authoritative identity source**, and how this process powers **IdentityIQ Identity Lifecycle**, 
**Access Certifications**, **Policy Violations**, and all downstream identity governance functions.

# 📄 Employee Authoritative Source – CSV File (Copy/Paste)

Save this file as:AuthEmployees.csv
```

## 📘 Basic Definitions (Beginner‑Friendly)

### 🔹 What is an *Application* in SailPoint?
An **Application** in SailPoint represents any external system from which you bring account data.  
Examples: Active Directory, Workday, Database, or a **CSV file** (DelimitedFile connector).

### 🔹 What is an *Authoritative Application*?
An **Authoritative Source** is a system that provides the **primary identity data** (source of truth).  
Examples: HR systems like Workday, SAP HR, Oracle HCM, CSV files with employee data.

In SailPoint:
- Only **one** authoritative application is used to *create identities*.
- The authoritative app **owns lifecycle** (joiner/mover/leaver events).

### 🔹 What is an *Account Schema*?
A Schema defines:
- Which attributes to read (employeeId, firstName…)
- Which attribute uniquely identifies accounts
- Which attribute displays the name
- Which attributes are multi‑valued

### 🔹 What is Aggregation?
Aggregation = Loading accounts from the application into SailPoint.

## Part 1 – Super Simple Definitions (explained like you’re 10)

---
| Word you will hear | What it REALLY means (in plain English) | Real-life example |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Application**     | Any system or file that knows about people | • HR system<br>• Active Directory<br>• A CSV file on your laptop |
| **Authoritative Application** | The ONE file/system that is **always right** about who works here | Your company’s HR system (or the CSV we use in training) is the boss. It says who exists, who is active, who their manager is, etc. |
| **Identity**        | The “person card” inside SailPoint | One Identity = one real human being (you, me, Bob from accounting) |
| **Account**         | A login somewhere | Bob has an account in Active Directory, an account in Gmail, an account in SAP → 3 accounts, but still only 1 Identity |
| **Identity Attribute** | The employee number that NEVER changes | Usually called employeeId or Employee Number – this is the unique ID card number |
| **Display Attribute** | The name you actually see in the system | Usually “John Smith” or “john.smith@company.com” – makes it easy to find people |
| **Schema**          | Just a list of columns in your CSV file | Like the header row: employeeId, firstName, lastName, email… |
| **Aggregation**     | The button that says “Go read the file now” | Click → SailPoint reads the CSV and creates/updates people |
---
Think of it like this:  
The HR CSV file is the **official employee list**.  
SailPoint reads it and creates a digital version of every employee inside itself.  
That digital version is called an **Identity**.

# 📝 Step-by-Step Guide  
## Build a CSV-Based Authoritative Source in SailPoint IIQ  
**Application Name:** `HR Employees`  
**File:** `/home/spadmin/ImplementerTraining/data/AuthEmployees.csv`

---

# 🧩 Why are we doing each step?

This guide not only *tells you what to click* — it explains **WHY**.

---

# 🔵 Step 1 — Create the Application

### ✔️ What to Do
1. Login to IIQ as `spadmin`
2. Go to **Applications → Application Definition**
3. Click **Add New Application**
4. Enter the following:

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| **Name** | HR Employees |
| **Owner** | spadmin |
| **Type** | DelimitedFile |
| **Authoritative Application** | ✔ Checked |

### ❓ Why this step?
- Naming matters because later workflows refer to this name.
- Authoritative Application = This CSV will *create identities*.
- DelimitedFile = We are ingesting from a CSV file.

---

# 🔵 Step 2 — Configure File Settings

### ✔️ What to Do  
Go to **Configuration → Settings** and set:

| Setting | Value |
|--------|--------|
| **File Path** | `/home/spadmin/ImplementerTraining/data/AuthEmployees.csv` |
| **Delimiter** | `,` |
| **File has header row** | ✔ Checked |

### ❓ Why this step?
This tells SailPoint **where to find the CSV** and how to read it.

---

# 🔵 Step 3 — Discover Schema

### ✔️ What to Do  
Go to **Configuration → Schema** → Click **Discover Schema Attributes** (big blue button)

IdentityIQ will read the header row of your CSV and auto-create all attributes.

You should now see attributes like:
Discovered attributes

```
employeeId
firstName
lastName
managerId
fullName
email
department
region
location
inactiveUser
jobtitle
costcenter
workStatus
```

### ❓ Why this step?
The schema defines:
- How accounts look
- Which attributes to read
- How IIQ identifies unique users

---

# 🔵 Step 4 — Set Identity & Display Attributes

### ✔️ What to Do

1. Edit **employeeId**
   - Click **Set as Identity Attribute**
2. Edit **fullName**
   - Click **Set as Display Attribute**

### ❓ Why this step?
| Attribute | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Identity Attribute** | Unique key for accounts (`employeeId`) |
| **Display Attribute** | Human-readable name (`fullName`) |

---

# 🔵 Step 5 — Mark `costcenter` as Multi-Valued

### ✔️ What to Do  
Edit **costcenter** → Tick **Multi-Valued** → Save

### ❓ Why this step?
Some users belong to multiple cost centers:
```
IT;HR;APAC;Finance
```
IIQ must store this as a **list**, not a single value.

---

# 🔵 Step 6 — Preview Data

### ✔️ What to Do  
Click **Preview** → See the first 10 accounts.

### ❓ Why this step?
Preview helps confirm:
- Data is read correctly
- Header columns match schema
- Multi-valued columns split correctly

---

# 🔵 Step 7 — Exclude Comments in CSV

Your CSV contains commented rows:

```
// Test Employee  
// Invalid record  
```

### ✔️ What to Do  
Settings → Filtering:

| Setting | Value |
|--------|--------|
| **Filter Empty** | ✔ Checked |
| **Comment Character** | `//` |

### ❓ Why this step?
Prevents garbage rows from being aggregated.

---

# 🔵 Step 8 — Test Connection

Click **Test Connection**

### ❓ Why this step?
SailPoint validates:
- File exists
- Delimiter works
- Schema can be parsed

---

# 🔵 Step 9 — Save Application  
Simple but important — IIQ does not auto-save.

---

# 🟩 Final Result You Achieved  
By completing this guide:

### ✅ Created HR Employees Authoritative Source  
### ✅ Configured schema (identity, display, multi-valued)  
### ✅ Enabled clean data ingestion  
### ✅ Ensured row filtering  
### ✅ Verified the connection  
### ✅ Prepared IIQ for account aggregation  

This is the **foundation** for:
- Identity creation  
- Manager relationships  
- Authoritative identity cube building  
- Joiner/Mover/Leaver lifecycle
